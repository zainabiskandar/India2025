    title: "Day 1 · Chennai | The Arrival",
    location: "Chennai, Tamil Nadu",
    content: "We land in the soft light of morning. I have not slept much, but I am in India, so I am happy. Immigration is a breeze. I smile and tell the truth: I am here to visit (future) friends, and I am staying at Anna University. The officer nods, stamps, and waves me through — a smooth welcome to India, like the smooth landing before it. Thank you, SIA pilot.\n\nOutside, Ms Sithara, our programme coordinator, is waiting, warm and calm, with the Confederation of Indian Industry (CII) team beside her. We are gathered, counted, and whisked onto a mini-bus. Chennai opens around us: scooters, buses, horns, morning dust lifting in the sun, sari colours blurring at the edge of the road. I sit by the window and let the city introduce itself.\n\nAt Anna University we collect our keys and climb some stairs. We open the door and just stare. \"She really gatekept this,\" someone (could have been me) laughs. The rooms are clean, bright, stocked with amenities, and there is daily housekeeping. I did not expect comfort like this. I feel looked after in a way I cannot name. A good start. We put our things down, note the breakfast spot, and are led to the campus restaurant for our first meal.\n\nWatermelon juice arrives, cold and sweet. Briyani follows, fragrant and warm. At the table I sit with my friends for the next ten days. We trade names and short stories to keep ourselves awake. We laugh, we eat, we keep eating. When the lime juice comes they ask, \"Salt or sugar?\" Salt sounds new. I say salt because part of immersion is saying yes to small unknowns. I gulp it down because everyone is ready to rest, and it is shockingly refreshing. I tell myself I will bring this recipe home.\n\nWe break for an hour, almost two. I try to power-nap. My roommate wakes me gently and I wash up. We change for the afternoon programme.\n\nOur first session is at a hotel: tea with Mr Shankar, President of Kumaraguru Institutions and office holder for many...organisations. He speaks without fuss, the way people do when they have done the work for a long time. He sketches Tamil Nadu in clean lines: literacy, industry, innovation, a habit of building patiently. During Q&A, Jin En, the South Asian Studies student among us, asks about the reservation system; the exchange is frank and thoughtful. I listen. I have questions, but I hold them for later.\n\nBiscuits arrive and I eat them like treasure. The first sip of chai is everything I hoped for. I keep my fingers wrapped around the teacup for warmth. And perhaps to channel the small nerves that come with what feels like the start of a series of introductions. After the session I catch Mr Shankar, thank him, and tell him one number stayed with me: women make up twenty percent of MNC leadership in the South. I ask if that holds across India or if it is particular to Tamil Nadu. He says that number is for here. He talks about the entrepreneurial space —how bright it is, how many women founders he is seeing. He mentions a woman in Coimbatore who started a femtech company and says we might meet her. I say that would be wonderful.\n\nAs he speaks, I steady. I applied for many reasons...business, entrepreneurship, women who build, people who care about what they do...and the words begin to return. My purpose for the trip starts to take texture.\n\nWe step back out into the afternoon and head into town. There is a Deepavali market near the museum: Hasthakala! Bangles flash, pashminas ripple, bronze sellers call from under bright awnings. I am excited to spend money. I am ready to shop. I buy a pair of white juttis, haggled from eight hundred to six hundred rupees. Perfect pair, perfect size. I should have bought more, I think, but it is alright. Over the next few days these shoes accompany me for most outfits, and I learn to sink into their footprints.\n\nI circle the stalls once before choosing where to buy scarves. The first time, the son quotes me a price; I keep walking, as one should. After the shoes, I return and find the father behind the counter. We talk easily. I know what I want. I choose two pashminas, bring the total down from sixteen hundred to twelve hundred. Small guilt catches at me because bargaining is always a line to walk, but student budgets are real and I am sure there is still profit in it. He sees my face and says, \"If you are happy, I am happy.\" We smile.\n\nBack at the meeting point, a friend asks what I bought. I show him the scarves. He wants two for his mother and his aunt, so I lead him back to the same stall and introduce them. He gets the same price. We leave with our small bundles, and I feel it. This is the way threads meet and the way tapestries form. Not just transaction, but relationship. Not just rupees, but regard. I begin to feel this spirit of India, and it makes me quietly happy.\n\nEvening draws us to the Taj Hotel for dinner with the CII leadership. The lobby is all marble and light, and a conference room is set with placards bearing our names. It is formal, more formal than I expected for the first day, but I am ready. In the ladies' room the girls are laughing with Ms Sithara. I open my bag and pass around the stack of scarves I brought to lend. We try colours. We help each other choose. I change into my kebaya set. We walk in together.\n\nThe evening opens with a sweep of Chennai's past — dynasties and ports, tales and trade, the way a city is braided over centuries. The rest of the dinner is names and handshakes, roles and intentions, a map beginning to draw itself. Much of it passes in a blur because the day is long and full, and because some rooms are meant to be absorbed more than retold. You just had to be there.\n\nThe meal is generous. At the end a man prepares filter coffee in front of us, pouring from height, froth meeting steel with a soft clap. We say a Tamil word for \"cheers,\" then laugh because in Singapore that word belongs to another kind of night. Little things like this make me hopeful for the ten days ahead — delicious, insightful, a new world willing to be learned.\n\nWe ride the mini-bus back to Anna University. My roommate finishes some work on her laptop. I scroll once through school updates, then close the tabs so I can be here. It has been a long first day. To think we arrived only hours ago and did so much. I can't have any excuses now when back in Singapore...I switch off the light, whisper alhamdulillah, and let the new city hold the rest."
