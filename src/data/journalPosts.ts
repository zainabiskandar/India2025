    title: "Goodbye Singapore",
    location: "Singapore",
    whereWeWent: "The week before India passes in a blur of late nights and half-packed bags. I try my best to prepare for the ten days ahead, knowing I will miss some important classes but grateful there are no tests or assignments due. Still, my rhythm feels disrupted. I worry about falling behind, about how my professors might perceive my absence, about leaving things unfinished. In the end, I remind myself that sometimes doing what you can is already enough.\n\nIt is, in many ways, an exercise in adaptability. I think of people whose work takes them away on short notice...and wonder if this might be a small rehearsal for that kind of life. You learn to move quickly, adjust your pace, and trust that the rest will fall into place.\n\nMusic carries me through those long nights. I find myself replaying Young Hearts Run Free by Candi Staton over and over again. It becomes my small anthem of courage, a song to keep my heart light. I redownload Spotify and begin a playlist for India: instrumental tracks, Tamil songs I have never heard before, a few familiar Bollywood pieces. I want sound to accompany sight, rhythm to accompany memory. My relationship with music has been complicated, but this time I allow it back in. I want every moment of this trip to have a place to return to, a sound that reminds me how I felt before it even began.",
    conversation: "The morning of the flight arrives quietly. I have not slept at all. My parents wake early to send me off before my father leaves for work. It is just the three of us at the airport. We have breakfast downstairs; everything feels peaceful and familiar. Between sips of Milo and small talk, I try to memorise their faces and their voices. I know I will not see them for ten days, and while I am excited for the independence, I also feel a quiet ache. I am grateful that they trust me enough to go, that they are letting their daughter—the one who loves to wander—wander again.\n\nIt has been a season of travel for our family. Within a single week, my parents and brother fly to Bali, my sister to Japan, and now me to India. Only my youngest sister stays behind, but she shares in our adventures from home. We joke that the house must feel too quiet without us.",
    numberFact: "Before the trip, my father tells me to change the quote I had chosen for this website I was building. \"Maybe something by that guy...the former president...Abdul Kalam,\" he says, half-absentmindedly but with that instinct fathers have for meaning. I do not know then that I will encounter not just Kalam's words, but the spirit of what he stood for: vision, humility, and hope stitched into the ordinary rhythms of life. India has a way of teaching you the lessons you did not know you were being prepared for.",
    reflection: "That quiet suggestion, offered over breakfast in the calm before departure, was the best parting gift my parents could have given me.",
    tomorrow: "A few hours later, I am airborne, en route to Incredible India.",

    title: "Day 1 · Chennai | The Arrival",
    location: "Chennai, Tamil Nadu",
    whereWeWent: "We land in the soft light of morning. I have not slept much, but I am in India, so I am happy. Immigration is a breeze. I smile and tell the truth: I am here to visit (future) friends, and I am staying at Anna University. The officer nods, stamps, and waves me through — a smooth welcome to India, like the smooth landing before it. Thank you, SIA pilot.\n\nOutside, Ms Sithara, our programme coordinator, is waiting, warm and calm, with the Confederation of Indian Industry (CII) team beside her. We are gathered, counted, and whisked onto a mini-bus. Chennai opens around us: scooters, buses, horns, morning dust lifting in the sun, sari colours blurring at the edge of the road. I sit by the window and let the city introduce itself.\n\nAt Anna University we collect our keys and climb some stairs. We open the door and just stare. \"She really gatekept this,\" someone (could have been me) laughs. The rooms are clean, bright, stocked with amenities, and there is daily housekeeping. I did not expect comfort like this. I feel looked after in a way I cannot name. A good start. We put our things down, note the breakfast spot, and are led to the campus restaurant for our first meal.\n\nWatermelon juice arrives, cold and sweet. Briyani follows, fragrant and warm. At the table I sit with my friends for the next ten days. We trade names and short stories to keep ourselves awake. We laugh, we eat, we keep eating. When the lime juice comes they ask, \"Salt or sugar?\" Salt sounds new. I say salt because part of immersion is saying yes to small unknowns. I gulp it down because everyone is ready to rest, and it is shockingly refreshing. I tell myself I will bring this recipe home.",
    conversation: "Our first session is at a hotel: tea with Mr Shankar, President of Kumaraguru Institutions and office holder for many...organisations. He speaks without fuss, the way people do when they have done the work for a long time. He sketches Tamil Nadu in clean lines: literacy, industry, innovation, a habit of building patiently. During Q&A, Jin En, the South Asian Studies student among us, asks about the reservation system; the exchange is frank and thoughtful. I listen. I have questions, but I hold them for later.\n\nBiscuits arrive and I eat them like treasure. The first sip of chai is everything I hoped for. I keep my fingers wrapped around the teacup for warmth. And perhaps to channel the small nerves that come with what feels like the start of a series of introductions. After the session I catch Mr Shankar, thank him, and tell him one number stayed with me: women make up twenty percent of MNC leadership in the South. I ask if that holds across India or if it is particular to Tamil Nadu. He says that number is for here. He talks about the entrepreneurial space —how bright it is, how many women founders he is seeing. He mentions a woman in Coimbatore who started a femtech company and says we might meet her. I say that would be wonderful.\n\nAs he speaks, I steady. I applied for many reasons...business, entrepreneurship, women who build, people who care about what they do...and the words begin to return. My purpose for the trip starts to take texture.",
    numberFact: "Women make up twenty percent of MNC leadership in South India. Mr Shankar spoke of the entrepreneurial space—how bright it is, how many women founders he is seeing. A woman in Coimbatore started a femtech company. The landscape for women in business here feels alive with possibility.",
    reflection: "Evening draws us to the Taj Hotel for dinner with the CII leadership. The lobby is all marble and light, and a conference room is set with placards bearing our names. It is formal, more formal than I expected for the first day, but I am ready. In the ladies' room the girls are laughing with Ms Sithara. I open my bag and pass around the stack of scarves I brought to lend. We try colours. We help each other choose. I change into my kebaya set. We walk in together.\n\nThe evening opens with a sweep of Chennai's past — dynasties and ports, tales and trade, the way a city is braided over centuries. The rest of the dinner is names and handshakes, roles and intentions, a map beginning to draw itself. Much of it passes in a blur because the day is long and full, and because some rooms are meant to be absorbed more than retold. You just had to be there.\n\nThe meal is generous. At the end a man prepares filter coffee in front of us, pouring from height, froth meeting steel with a soft clap. We say a Tamil word for \"cheers,\" then laugh because in Singapore that word belongs to another kind of night. Little things like this make me hopeful for the ten days ahead — delicious, insightful, a new world willing to be learned.",
    tomorrow: "We ride the mini-bus back to Anna University. My roommate finishes some work on her laptop. I scroll once through school updates, then close the tabs so I can be here. It has been a long first day. To think we arrived only hours ago and did so much. I can't have any excuses now when back in Singapore...I switch off the light, whisper alhamdulillah, and let the new city hold the rest.",
