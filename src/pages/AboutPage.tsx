                Hi everyone, and welcome to my corner of the internet for an upcoming adventure.
              </p>

              <p className="text-lg mb-6" style={{ color: 'var(--text)' }}>
                In a few days, I will be embarking on The India Experience 2025, an immersion programme across Chennai and Coimbatore. I have never been to India before, and even now, as I write this, it feels a little surreal to say that I will be going.
              </p>

              <p className="text-lg mb-6" style={{ color: 'var(--text)' }}>
                Many people close to me call India home, and I think of dear Kim, Ishita, Nandini, Janhavee, Muwafiqa, and Rahul‚Äîall of whom have been so generous with their stories of their motherland, each sharing its varied rhythms and colours. We had always made plans to journey there together, and who would have thought that I would make the trip alone first. But I am excited to see for myself what connection, culture, and home might look like beyond what I know, and I hope to join more travels in the future, insyaAllah.
              </p>

              <p className="text-lg mb-6" style={{ color: 'var(--text)' }}>
                I chose to take this trip because I felt a quiet pull towards it‚Äîan opportunity not just to see a new place, but to explore questions that have always lived quietly in me about belonging, identity, and meaning. And honestly, how could I, as someone with a touch of wanderlust, say no?
              </p>

              <p className="text-lg mb-6" style={{ color: 'var(--text)' }}>
                For me, this journey is not only about travel or a short leave from school. It is also a kind of discovery‚Äîof place, of ideas, of faith, and, as with every adventure, of myself.
              </p>

              <p className="text-lg mb-6" style={{ color: 'var(--text)' }}>
                I have found that writing helps me make sense of what I am feeling and learning, so I hope this website becomes a space where I try to do that‚Äîgently, honestly, and with immense gratitude for the opportunity I have been given. Here, you will find my reflections, the moments that stay with me, and lessons from people I meet along the way. Some days may be long and detailed, while others may simply be a sentence or a photograph, but each one, I hope, will carry a little sincerity‚Äîand update you, Mama, that I am alive.
              </p>

              <p className="text-lg mb-0" style={{ color: 'var(--text)' }}>
                If you are reading this, thank you for being here. If you would like to receive daily updates, you can drop your email at the bottom of this page. I hope this space becomes not only a record of what I see, but also of how I grow.
