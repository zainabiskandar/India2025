                Hi, everyone. Welcome to my corner of the internet, where I'll be documenting an adventure that I'll soon be embarking on‚Äîa 10-day immersion across Chennai and Coimbatore, India. This is my first time visiting India, and I find myself both excited and curious about what lies ahead.

                This journal isn't just about recording what happens. It's about pausing to reflect, to question, and to truly absorb the experiences as they unfold. I've always believed that the most meaningful learning happens when we take the time to process our observations, to sit with our questions, and to be honest about what we don't yet understand.
              </p>

              <p className="text-lg mb-0" style={{ color: 'var(--text)' }}>
                So consider this both a travelogue and a thinking space‚Äîsomewhere between a formal journal and an ongoing conversation with myself about culture, community, and what it means to step outside familiar boundaries.

                I decided to go on this trip because it was an opportunity I didn't want to miss. When I first heard about the India Experience programme, something about it felt right‚Äînot just intellectually interesting, but personally significant. There was a pull toward understanding a part of the world I knew very little about, beyond the surface-level narratives we often encounter.

              <p className="text-lg" style={{ color: 'var(--text)' }}>
                My intentions for this journey are both specific and open-ended. Specifically, I want to [placeholder: e.g., "understand how traditional values coexist with rapid modernization," "learn about community-led innovation," "observe how different cultures approach problem-solving"]. But I'm also intentionally leaving space for the unexpected‚Äîthe conversations I didn't anticipate, the questions I didn't know to ask, the moments that shift how I see not just India, but my own context back home.

                Beyond the structured programme activities and planned site visits, I'm most curious about the in-between moments‚Äîthe informal conversations, the observations that happen when you're just walking through a neighbourhood, the patterns you start to notice after a few days in a place. I want to understand not just what people do, but why they do it, and what that reveals about different ways of organizing society, family, community, and purpose.
